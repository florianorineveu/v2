## Overview
This repository contains the source code of my future personal website, which is powered by Io, a personal back office.
Io is a Symfony-based back office, which is designed to be friendly and easily reusable. It's written in PHP 8.2 with SCSS and vanilla JavaScript for the front-end. It's still in development.
